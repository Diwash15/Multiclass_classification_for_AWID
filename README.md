# Multiclass_classification_for_AWID
I used AWID dataset, AWID-CLS-R-Trn for training and AWID-CLS-R-Tst for testing puposes. 
It has multiple classes: normal, injection, impersonation and flodding attack types, which is multi-class classification problem.
And,I used dense neural network and RNN with LSTM against the dataset to get the accuracy and evaluation metrics.
